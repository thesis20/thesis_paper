abstract = {Item recommendation is the task of predicting a personalized ranking on a set of items (e.g. websites, movies, products). In this paper, we investigate the most common scenario with implicit feedback (e.g. clicks, purchases). There are many methods for item recommendation from implicit feedback like matrix factorization (MF) or adaptive k-nearest-neighbor (kNN). Even though these methods are designed for the item prediction task of personalized ranking, none of them is directly optimized for ranking. In this paper we present a generic optimization criterion BPR-Opt for personalized ranking that is the maximum posterior estimator derived from a Bayesian analysis of the problem. We also provide a generic learning algorithm for optimizing models with respect to BPR-Opt. The learning method is based on stochastic gradient descent with bootstrap sampling. We show how to apply our method to two state-of-the-art recommender models: matrix factorization and adaptive kNN. Our experiments indicate that for the task of personalized ranking our optimization method outperforms the standard learning techniques for MF and kNN. The results show the importance of optimizing models for the right criterion.},

This approach supports multiple dimensions, profiling information, and hierarchical aggregation of recommendations. The article also presents a multidimensional rating estimation method capable of selecting two-dimensional segments of ratings pertinent to the recommendation context and applying standard collaborative filtering or other traditional two-dimensional rating estimation techniques to these segments. A comparison of the multidimensional and two-dimensional rating estimation approaches is made, and the tradeoffs between the two are studied. Moreover, the article introduces a combined rating estimation method, which identifies the situations where the MD approach outperforms the standard two-dimensional approach and uses the MD approach in those situations and the standard two-dimensional approach elsewhere. Finally, the article presents a pilot empirical study of the combined approach, using a multidimensional movie recommender system that was developed for implementing this approach and testing its performance.},

abstract = {Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommendations are computed by leveraging a historical data set of users' ratings for items. It assumes that the users' previously recorded ratings can help in predicting future ratings. This has been validated extensively, but in some domains item ratings can be influenced by contextual conditions, such as the time or the goal of the item consumption. This type of information is not exploited by standard CF models. This paper introduces and analyzes a novel pre-filtering technique for context-aware CF called item splitting. In this approach, the ratings of certain items are split, according to the value of an item-dependent contextual condition. Each split item generates two fictitious items that are used in the prediction algorithm instead of the original one. We evaluated this approach on real world and semi-synthetic data sets using matrix-factorization and nearest neighbor CF algorithms. We show that item splitting can be beneficial and its performance depends on the item selection method and on the influence of the contextual variables on the item ratings.},

abstract = {Modern large retrieval environments tend to overwhelm their users by their large output. Since all documents are not of equal relevance to their users, highly relevant documents should be identified and ranked first for presentation. In order to develop IR techniques in this direction, it is necessary to develop evaluation approaches and methods that credit IR methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents. This can be done by extending traditional evaluation methods, that is, recall and precision based on binary relevance judgments, to graded relevance judgments. Alternatively, novel measures based on graded relevance judgments may be developed. This article proposes several novel measures that compute the cumulative gain the user obtains by examining the retrieval result up to a given ranked position. The first one accumulates the relevance scores of retrieved documents along the ranked result list. The second one is similar but applies a discount factor to the relevance scores in order to devaluate late-retrieved documents. The third one computes the relative-to-the-ideal performance of IR techniques, based on the cumulative gain they are able to yield. These novel measures are defined and discussed and their use is demonstrated in a case study using TREC data: sample system run results for 20 queries in TREC-7. As a relevance base we used novel graded relevance judgments on a four-point scale. The test results indicate that the proposed measures credit IR methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents and allow testing of statistical significance of effectiveness differences. The graphs based on the measures also provide insight into the performance IR techniques and allow interpretation, for example, from the user point of view.},

abstract = {To provide more accurate recommendation, it is a trending topic to go beyond modeling user-item interactions and take context features into account. Factorization Machines (FM) with negative sampling is a popular solution for context-aware recommendation. However, it is not robust as sampling may lost important information and usually leads to non-optimal performances in practical. Several recent efforts have enhanced FM with deep learning architectures for modelling high-order feature interactions. While they either focus on rating prediction task only, or typically adopt the negative sampling strategy for optimizing the ranking performance. Due to the dramatic fluctuation of sampling, it is reasonable to argue that these sampling-based FM methods are still suboptimal for context-aware recommendation. In this paper, we propose to learn FM without sampling for ranking tasks that helps context-aware recommendation particularly. Despite effectiveness, such a non-sampling strategy presents strong challenge in learning efficiency of the model. Accordingly, we further design a new ideal framework named Efficient Non-Sampling Factorization Machines (ENSFM). ENSFM not only seamlessly connects the relationship between FM and Matrix Factorization (MF), but also resolves the challenging efficiency issue via novel memorization strategies. Through extensive experiments on three real-world public datasets, we show that 1) the proposed ENSFM consistently and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on context-aware Top-K recommendation, and 2) ENSFM achieves significant advantages in training efficiency, which makes it more applicable to real-world large-scale systems. Moreover, the empirical results indicate that a proper learning method is even more important than advanced neural network structures for Top-K recommendation task. Our implementation has been released 1 to facilitate further developments on efficient non-sampling methods. },

abstract = {Many previous studies attempt to utilize information from other domains to achieve better performance of recommendation. Recently, social information has been shown effective in improving recommendation results with transfer learning frameworks, and the transfer part helps to learn users' preferences from both item domain and social domain. However, two vital issues have not been well-considered in existing methods: 1) Usually, a static transfer scheme is adopted to share a user's common preference between item and social domains, which is not robust in real life where the degrees of sharing and information richness are varied for different users. Hence a non-personalized transfer scheme may be insufficient and unsuccessful. 2) Most previous neural recommendation methods rely on negative sampling in training to increase computational efficiency, which makes them highly sensitive to sampling strategies and hence difficult to achieve optimal results in practical applications.To address the above problems, we propose an Efficient Adaptive Transfer Neural Network (EATNN). By introducing attention mechanisms, the proposed model automatically assign a personalized transfer scheme for each user. Moreover, we devise an efficient optimization method to learn from the whole training set without negative sampling, and further extend it to support multi-task learning. Extensive experiments on three real-world public datasets indicate that our EATNN method consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on Top-K recommendation task, especially for cold-start users who have few item interactions. Remarkably, EATNN shows significant advantages in training efficiency, which makes it more practical to be applied in real E-commerce scenarios. The code is available at (https://github.com/chenchongthu/EATNN).},

This article documents the history of MovieLens and the MovieLens datasets. We include a discussion of lessons learned from running a long-standing, live research platform from the perspective of a research organization. We document best practices and limitations of using the MovieLens datasets in new research.},
